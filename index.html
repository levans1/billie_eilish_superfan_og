			<p>Billie Eilish is a 17 year old singer and song writer born in Los Angeles, California.
		Billie's 9 song EP "Dont Smile At Me" featuring songs like Ocean Eyes, Copycat and Bellyache helped Billie gain popularity after it's realease in 2017.
		However her fame really skyrocketed after the release of her 2019 album, "When we all fall asleep where do we go". The lead single, "Bad Guy" stayed at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 9 weeks before fianlly knocking Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" out of the top spot.
		Billie is well known for her amazing stage prescence and theatrics and her April 2019 Coachella performance shows that. At 17, Eilish was the youngest ever Coachella performer in the history of the festival. Billie is also well known for her eccentric music videos and over the top fashion sense. Her videos for songs like
		"You Should See Me in a Crown" and "Bury a Friend" show her amazing creativity. Overall Eilish is a very interesting performer and artist and her fame is not something that will slow down soon. Billie is a part of the new generation of younger artists that teens and young adults can relate to.
